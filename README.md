# Supplementary Material for "Quasiclassical Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics"


Folder Simulation/ saves code and raw data for publication: Quasiclassical Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02299.

## Simulation/src/ 

- mmst_solver.cpp: MMST dynamics for N two-level systems (TLSs) interact with a multimode cavity.

- qed_solver.cpp: Quantum dynamics for N TLSs interact with a multimode cavity within the singly excited manifold (i.e., configurational interaction singles).

- parameters.hpp: usr defined parameters for the above two methods.

- compiler.sh: shell script for compiling the C++ codes

- perform_nersc.sh: shell script for submitting the MMST job to NERSC.

In order to run the above C++ code, please use linux and install g++7, mpic++, and the armadillo library (http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html). 

## Simulation/run*.sh

All these shell scripts can be directly submitted as jobs on NERSC.

## Simulation/data.tar.zst

Run "tar -I zstd -xvf data.tar.zst" to obtain the raw data generated by the run*.sh scripts.

Note that because data.tar.zst is very big (>1Gb), this file is saved via git-lsf (https://git-lfs.github.com/). 

The raw data can also be downloaded through https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQrE6pHkPaBIZFWU00Xziki_550Y-luU/view?usp=sharing

## Simulation/plot*.py

Run "python3 plot*.py" to directly plot the useful figures (in https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02299) from raw data.
